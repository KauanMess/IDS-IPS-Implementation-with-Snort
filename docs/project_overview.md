## Project_overview

This project consists of using the Snort tool in the IDS/IPS function in a controlled virtual environment to alert and drop packets from various connections in an internal network.

The techniques used were:
1. Snort
2. Network segmentation
3. Virtual machines
4. Ping 
5. Promiscuous mode on network interfaces

Remember to assign the correct IP to all machines and leave them on an internal/bridge network, otherwise it may generate errors.
