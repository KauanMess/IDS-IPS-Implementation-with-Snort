A simple project implementing IDS and IPS systems with the Snort tool.
# IDS Implementation with Snort

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an intrusion detection system (IDS) using Snort, focusing on detecting and blocking malicious packets on an internal network.

## Technologies Used
- **Snort**: IDS/IPS tool for packet monitoring.
- **Kali Linux**: Operating system for penetration testing and traffic generation.
- **Metasploitable**: Vulnerable machine used to simulate attacks.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how Snort can be configured to block ICMP packets (ping) and other threats by monitoring traffic on an internal network.

## Steps for Execution
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/IDS-Implementation-with-Snort.git
